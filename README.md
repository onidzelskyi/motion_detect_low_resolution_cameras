# Accurate Motion Detection in Low-Quality Surveillance Videos: Addressing Challenges and Exploring Solutions

## **Abstract:**

Accurate motion detection plays a crucial role in various surveillance applications. However, achieving this goal becomes significantly challenging with low-quality video recordings due to factors like low resolution, unstable connections, and dropped packets. These issues contribute to frame loss and distorted video streams, often leading to false positives in traditional motion detection algorithms.

## intended audience

### **Technical Audience:**

* Researchers and engineers working in computer vision, video processing, and surveillance systems.
* Developers interested in improving motion detection algorithms for low-quality videos.
* Students pursuing advanced degrees in related fields.

### **Informative Audience:**

* Professionals involved in security and surveillance using low-quality video systems.

* Individuals interested in the technical challenges and potential solutions for low-quality video analysis.

## **Introduction**

This research investigates effective solutions for robust motion detection in low-quality surveillance videos. We address the specific challenges posed by:

* **Limited visual information:** We explore techniques to compensate for the lack of detail in low-resolution videos, potentially employing super-resolution or edge detection techniques.
* **Network instability:** We investigate methods to handle dropped packets and unreliable connections, potentially utilizing error correction and packet loss concealment techniques.
* **Distorted data:** We evaluate approaches to mitigate the impact of frame loss and video distortion, potentially employing temporal consistency analysis or anomaly detection methods.

We evaluate the performance of different algorithms and approaches on real low-quality video samples, comparing their accuracy and robustness. The research aims to contribute to the advancement of reliable motion detection in real-world surveillance scenarios where optimal video quality is not always attainable.

This paper considers popular background removal algorithms with implementations in various libraries and languages, such as Python's OpenCV:

* Mixture of Gaussian (MOG)
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

We will analyze a sample video to extract signals indicating the presence of motion.
